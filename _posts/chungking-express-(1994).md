This movie was somewhat relatable. That desperation, being lonely in a crowded city. Accepting the reality, deciding to move on. This is sad and yet beautiful. The first half was frustrating and sad, and second part was almost like the first half, but no. The lighting gives this movie a retro vibe, almost every shot was in the night.

Many of us can never get to the place where we wanted to, but the journey in between makes us what we are. The experiences we gather, the lesson learn, the obstacles we face through this journey show us how cruel and beautiful life can be.
